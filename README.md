# Rubik's Cube Simulator

This is a Rubik's Cube Simulator, programmed in javascript and THREE.js

The following is a simple simulation of the achieved result 
a) The gif might render a big buggy on github, but the actual rotation is very smooth in the program 
b) The black border around the cubes, stays like a location of where the cubes will position themselves after rotation. If it seems trippy, one can disable the borders

A few features of the program:
1) A normal 3x3 Rubik's Cube

2) We can create Rubik's cube of different sizes

3) We can also change rotation Speed:

4) We can change spacing between cubes
